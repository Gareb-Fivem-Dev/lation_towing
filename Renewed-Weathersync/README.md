- **FiveM Server** - Artifact 4752 or higher recommended

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Weather Configuration (`config/weather.lua`)
```lua
return {
    useScheduledWeather = true,        -- Enable txAdmin scheduled weather
    serverDuration = 14,               -- Server runtime hours before restart
    weatherCycletimer = 30,            -- Minutes between weather changes
    timeBetweenRain = 180,            -- Minutes between rain events  
    rainAfterRestart = 60,            -- Minutes after restart before rain
    decemberSnow = true,              -- Snow-only mode in December
    
    -- Static weather probabilities
    useStaticWeather = true,
    staticWeather = {
        ['EXTRASUNNY'] = 0.4,         -- 40% chance
        ['CLEAR'] = 0.1,              -- 10% chance
        -- ... more weather types
    },
    
    -- Custom weather sequences
    useWeatherSequences = true,
    weatherSequences = {
        -- Define custom weather patterns
    }
}
```

### Time Configuration (`config/time.lua`)
```lua
return {
    timeScale = 4000,                 -- Milliseconds per GTA minute
    useNightScale = false,            -- Enable different night scaling
    timeScaleNight = 8000,           -- Night time scaling
    nightTime = {
        beginning = 22,               -- Night starts at 10 PM
        ending = 6                    -- Night ends at 6 AM
    },
    useRealTime = false,             -- Use server's real time
    startUpTime = {
        hour = 12,
        minute = 0
    }
}
```

## üéØ Usage

### Admin Commands
- `/weather` - Open weather management interface (requires admin permissions)

### For Developers
```lua
-- Get current weather information
local weather = exports['Renewed-Weathersync']:getCurrentWeather()
local weatherType = exports['Renewed-Weathersync']:getCurrentWeatherType()

-- Check weather conditions
local hasSnow = exports['Renewed-Weathersync']:hasSnow()
local windSpeed = exports['Renewed-Weathersync']:getWindSpeed()
```

## üîß Compatibility Setup

### Disabling CD Easy Time Compatibility
If you've never used cd_easytime, disable it by adding this to your `server.cfg`:
```
setr weather_disablecd true
```

### QB-Core Integration
This resource automatically provides compatibility with QB-Core and can be used as a drop-in replacement for qb-weathersync.
